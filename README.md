# Face detection with OpenCV
**This Python code uses OpenCV and multiple face classifiers to detect faces in a photo and save these faces to a folder.**

# Prerequisites
Python 3,
OpenCV

# Usage
1 > Download or clone this repository to your computer.

2 > Open a terminal and navigate to the code directory.

3 > Run the code by typing the following command: python detect_faces.py

4 > Follow the on-screen instructions to input the name of the image to process.

5 > The detected faces in the image will be saved to a folder named 'visage'.

# Notes
**You can also train your own face classifier using the AdaBoost algorithm using the OpenCV machine learning library, as described in the OpenCV documentation: [https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html](https://). However, this can be a complex process and requires a good understanding of machine learning and the OpenCV library.**
